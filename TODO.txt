TODO:
1. Convert the following classes to be a Utility classes (Abstract classes with static methods that holds no states):
    - `IDFCalculator`
    - `TFCalculator`
    - `DocumentVector`

2. Refactor the `DocumentVector` class to use the static methods from `IDFCalculator` and `TFCalculator` instead of instantiating them.

3. Rename DocumentVector to be VectorFactory that has a build method.

4. Add a Vector model class that holds required data.
